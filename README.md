# LIRI-Bot

## What is this project?
Liri is a program that functions like Siri using several different node packaging managers.

## How does it work? 
Through the Command-Line Interface, a user will be able to use 4 different commands and will receive information in return.

- The "concert-this" command will take in the name of the artist and will return their next concert's venue, date and time. By using the following command, for example, a user would be able to find out OneRepublic's next concert date.

```bash
node liri.js concert-this OneRepublic
```
![Concert-This](https://i.ibb.co/GJjbnxR/concert-this.jpg)

- "spotify-this-song" acts as a command that takes any song name and returns the artist, album and a preview link for the user to see.

```bash
node liri.js spotify-this-song Take On Me
```
